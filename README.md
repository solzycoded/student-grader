A teacher contacted me on Fiverr.com. The site that i use, as a freelance web developer. She wanted to automate the grading system for her kids and 
give them proper feedback, in pdf format. 

This project was built with Html, Css, Js, Jquery, Bootstrap, JsPDF plugin and PHP.

This project took me 5 days to build successfully.
